# Chitchat
A **MERN** Stack-based Real-Time Chat Application powered by Socket.IO for seamless user communication.

üëã **About This Project** <br>
This project is a fully functional real-time chat application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Socket.IO for real-time communication. It showcases my ability to build scalable, responsive, and user-friendly applications for modern web use cases.

üîë **Key Features**<br>
Real-Time Messaging: Send and receive messages instantly using WebSockets.<br>
User Authentication: Secure login and registration with hashed passwords.<br>
Avatar Customization: Users can set and update their profile avatars.<br>
Scalable Backend: Built with Express.js and MongoDB for robust performance.<br>
Socket.IO Integration: Real-time communication for seamless chat functionality.<br>
This project highlights my skills in building scalable backends, designing efficient REST APIs, and integrating real-time communication framework.<br>

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**<br>
MongoDB -	Database for storing users and messages.<br>
Express.js - Backend framework for REST API.<br>
React.js - Frontend for user interface.<br>
Node.js - Server-side JavaScript runtime.<br>
Socket.IO - Real-time communication protocol.<br>
Mongoose - ODM for MongoDB and schema definitions.<br>
bcrypt - Secure password hashing.<br>
dotenv - Environment variable management.<br>
